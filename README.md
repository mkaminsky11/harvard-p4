##Project 4: Dynamic Web Applications##
Hosted <a href="http://harvardp4-harvardp3.rhcloud.com">Here</a>

For this project, I created a cloud-based system for storing code snippets called "SnipSafe". Users access it by signing up and logging in. From the main screen, they can create, edit, and move their snippets.

Resources used:
<ol>
	<li>Laravel (duh)</li>
	<li>Polymer</li>
	<li>CodeMirror</li>
	<li>JQuery</li>
</ol>

Most of the project uses AJAX (via JQuery) to fetch and send data.
